## Instructions

## **🎯 Multi-Dimensional Navigator**

**Newsletters serve different purposes depending on your context. Find your path:**

### **STEP 1: What's Your Goal?**

Your primary goal determines everything about your newsletter strategy:

```
→ LEAD GENERATION - Generate inbound leads for sales team
→ THOUGHT LEADERSHIP - Build authority in your category
→ PERSONAL BRAND - Build your individual reputation
→ CATEGORY OWNERSHIP - Own the conversation in your space
```

### **STEP 2: What's Your Industry Vertical?**

Your industry determines:
- Content topics and angle
- Competitive positioning
- Tone and risk tolerance
- What's considered "valuable content"

```
→ Sales Tech - Tactical sales tips, conversation intelligence insights
→ HR Tech - People operations, employee engagement, compliance
→ Fintech - Financial regulations, payment trends, compliance updates
→ Operations Tech - Retail execution, supply chain, distribution
```

### **STEP 3: What's Your Company Stage?**

Your stage determines:
- Newsletter goals (lead gen vs thought leadership)
- Resources available (time, budget)
- Publishing frequency
- Content depth

```
→ Series A ($1M-10M ARR) - Lead gen focus, founder-led
→ Series B ($10M-50M ARR) - Thought leadership, team-led
→ Series C+ ($50M+ ARR) - Category ownership, dedicated team
```

### **STEP 4: Are You Founder or Employee?**

Your role determines:
- Editorial autonomy
- Approval workflows
- Personal vs company brand
- What you can/cannot say

```
→ Founder - Full autonomy, personal = company brand
→ VP/Director - Partial autonomy, manager approval
→ PMM/Content Lead - Team collaboration, brand guidelines
→ Employee (Non-Leadership) - Significant constraints
```

### **STEP 5: What's Your Primary Market?**

Your geography determines:
- Publishing times (IST vs EST)
- Content examples (Indian vs US companies)
- Distribution channels (WhatsApp vs LinkedIn)

```
→ India-first - IST times, local examples, price-conscious
→ US-first - EST/PST times, US examples
