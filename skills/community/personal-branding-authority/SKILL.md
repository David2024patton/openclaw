## Instructions

## 🎯 MULTI-DIMENSIONAL NAVIGATOR

**Most Critical Decision: Are you Founder or Employee?**

This determines everything else about your personal branding strategy.

### Founder Personal Brand:
- Full autonomy (no approval needed)
- Personal = company brand (tightly coupled)  
- Can be contrarian (if industry allows)
- High risk, high reward
- Exit complexity (brand tied to company forever)

### Employee Personal Brand:  
- Manager approval required
- Must align with company messaging
- Limited topics and positioning
- Need portable brand strategy  
- Lower risk, constrained upside

**Framework Application:**
1. Identify your role (Founder/VP/Employee)
2. Identify your industry (Sales/HR/Fintech/Ops Tech)
3. Identify your stage (Series A/B/C+)
4. Apply appropriate playbook from sections below
