## Instructions

# Attribution Engine

## 1. What this skill does

Attribution Engine helps creators prepare clear, platform-aware credits and
disclosures before publishing.

It focuses on **clarity**, **consistency**, and **platform alignment**, so your
work travels cleanly across feeds, remixes, and reposts without unnecessary
confusion later.

This skill does not tell you what you are legally required to do.  
It helps you organize and format information using each platform’s own rules.

## 2. Important note before we begin

Before using this skill, you will see a short notice:

> This tool helps format attribution and disclosure information using publicly
> available platform guidance.  
> It does not provide legal advice, determine compliance, or guarantee outcomes.
> You remain responsible for how and where content is published.

## 3. Why attribution matters in 2026

Attribution is no longer just courtesy.

Platforms now use attribution and disclosure signals to decide:
- how content is labeled
- how far it travels
- whether it is limited, flagged, or reviewed

Small mismatches, like forgetting a native toggle or using the wrong AI label,
can quietly reduce reach or trigger reviews.

This skill helps you catch those issues early.

## 4. Core concepts (plain language)

### Attribution
Who should be credited publicly for the work.

Example:
- Performer
- Producer
- Visual artist
- Brand partner
- Tool or system used

### Disclosure
Whether viewers need to be told something important about how the content was
made or funded.

Examples:
- AI-assisted editing
- Synthetic or altered media
- Paid or gifted brand relationships

### Provenance
How the content came into being.

Examples:
- Fully human-authored
- Human-authored with AI assistance
- Fully AI-generated

## 5. Human vs AI labels (avoiding over-labeling)

Not all AI use is the same.

Over-labeling simple edits as “AI-generated” can cause platforms to treat your
work as low-effort or mass-produced.
