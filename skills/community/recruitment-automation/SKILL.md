## Instructions

# Recruitment Automation Agent

> "Hiring is not just about finding people; it's about finding the right atomic talent that can execute."

Stop wasting hours on manual sourcing and screening. This agent automates the entire top-of-funnel recruitment workflow, delivering high-signal candidate data and ready-to-send outreach drafts.

Move from job description to interview-ready candidates at physics-defying speed.

## Usage

```
/recruit "role title, and job description"
```

## What You Get

### 1. Global Talent Search
The agent uses Tavily to scour the entire web, including LinkedIn and GitHub, to identify at least 8 high-potential candidates and shortlists the top 5 with real, verified data.

### 2. First-Principles AI Evaluation
No generic summaries. The agent assigns a ruthlessly objective Fit Rating (1–10) and performs a deep technical assessment of each candidate's expertise vs. your requirements.

### 3. Automated Tracking Sheet
A Google Sheet is instantly created and populated with the shortlist. Full traceability: names, roles, companies, locations, skill sets, and direct profile URLs.

### 4. High-Signal Recommendations
Candidates are ranked as Strong Match, Good Match, or Potential. You get a clear priority list so you know exactly who to talk to first.

### 5. Ready-to-Send Gmail Draft
The final deliverable is a fully rendered Gmail draft. It includes the top 3 ranked candidates with their ratings and a link to the tracking sheet. No placeholders. No generic templates. Just data.
