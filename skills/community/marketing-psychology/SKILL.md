## Foundational Thinking Models

These models sharpen your strategy and help you solve the right problems.

### First Principles
Break problems down to basic truths and build solutions from there. Instead of copying competitors, ask "why" repeatedly to find root causes. Use the 5 Whys technique to tunnel down to what really matters.

**Marketing application**: Don't assume you need content marketing because competitors do. Ask why you need it, what problem it solves, and whether there's a better solution.

### Jobs to Be Done
People don't buy products—they "hire" them to get a job done. Focus on the outcome customers want, not features.

**Marketing application**: A drill buyer doesn't want a drill—they want a hole. Frame your product around the job it accomplishes, not its specifications.

### Circle of Competence
Know what you're good at and stay within it. Venture outside only with proper learning or expert help.

**Marketing application**: Don't chase every channel. Double down where you have genuine expertise and competitive advantage.

### Inversion
Instead of asking "How do I succeed?", ask "What would guarantee failure?" Then avoid those things.

**Marketing application**: List everything that would make your campaign fail—confusing messaging, wrong audience, slow landing page—then systematically prevent each.
