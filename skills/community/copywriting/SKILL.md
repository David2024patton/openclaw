## Copywriting Principles

### Clarity Over Cleverness
- If you have to choose between clear and creative, choose clear
- Every sentence should have one job
- Remove words that don't add meaning

### Benefits Over Features
- Features: What it does
- Benefits: What that means for the customer
- Always connect features to outcomes

### Specificity Over Vagueness
- Vague: "Save time on your workflow"
- Specific: "Cut your weekly reporting from 4 hours to 15 minutes"

### Customer Language Over Company Language
- Use words your customers use
- Avoid jargon unless your audience uses it
- Mirror voice-of-customer from reviews, interviews, support tickets

### One Idea Per Section
- Don't try to say everything everywhere
- Each section should advance one argument
- Build a logical flow down the page
