# x-article-editor

TL;DR: Turn a topic or draft into a high-engagement X Article.

## Source

- **Author**: tree
- **Category**: Marketing & Sales  
- **Original**: [x-article-editor](https://github.com/openclaw/skills/tree/main/skills/jchopard69/x-article-editor/SKILL.md)
- **Security Status**: SAFE

## Instructions

# X Article Editor (8-step framework)

## Summary

- Input: either a draft X Article **or** a short brief (topic + inspiration).
- Output: always **two steps**:
  1) `=== FINAL ARTICLE (COPY/PASTE) ===` (clean final text)
  2) framework review + score out of 80 (to maximize performance)

References:
- `references/quick-prompts.md` (copy/paste prompts)
- `references/publishing-checklist.md` (pre-publish checklist)

## Operating modes

Support two modes:

1) **Edit mode (default)**
- User provides an existing **draft X Article**.
- Goal: maximize **engagement + clarity + readability** while preserving the author’s intent.

2) **Write-from-brief mode**
- User provides a **topic** + optional inspiration points (bullets/links/notes).
- Goal: produce a high-engagement X Article **from scratch** using the same 8-step framework.

Global rules:
- Never mention you used AI/tools for research.
- Language:
  - Default: match the user’s input language.
  - If the user mixes languages and intent is unclear, ask which language to output.

## Two-step workflow (always)

Make it unambiguous: **write first, then review**.

### STEP 1: WRITE (FULL ARTICLE)

- In **Edit mode**: rewrite the draft into the best possible version.
- In **Write-from-brief mode**: write the full article from scratch.

Output the article under this exact heading:

`=== FINAL ARTICLE (COPY/PASTE) ===`

Under that heading, output ONLY the final article content (no commentary, no brackets).

### STEP 2: REVIEW (FRAMEWORK CHECK + SCORING)

After the final article, run a scored audit out of **80** (10 points per criterion) to maximize performance on X:

- OVERALL SCORE: X/80
- CRITICAL FIXES (Top 3 highest-impact improvements):
  1. …
  2. …
  3. …

Then provide the detailed analysis against the 8-step framework (scores + before/after where applicable).

1) CLEAR PURPOSE (Score: X/10)
- What you’re trying to achieve: (think/feel/do)
- Target audience clarity
- Issue
- Fix

2) TITLE & HOOK (Score: X/10)
- Title eff
