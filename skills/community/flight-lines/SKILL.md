# Flight Lines

## Theoretical Ground

Knowledge gets organized into **domains**—epidemiology, jazz theory, mycology, contract law. These are stratifications: useful for organizing expertise but not fundamental boundaries. They're territories.

**Operations** exist beneath these strata. "Sentinel surveillance" isn't essentially about disease—it's a capacity: strategic monitoring of high-signal locations in sparse search spaces. "Reharmonization" isn't essentially about jazz—it's changing underlying structure while preserving surface continuity. Operations are **deterritorialized capacities** that got captured by domain-strata through historical accident.

The conventional approach to problems stays within domain boundaries. Dating advice for dating problems. Language pedagogy for language problems. This is navigating along the strata—safe, predictable, limited.

**Lines of flight** are movements that escape stratified territories. When you recognize that rare book dealer "want list circulation" addresses the same structural constraint as epidemiological "contact tracing"—and both could apply to finding collaborators in a new city—you're accessing operations on a **plane of consistency** where domain labels don't constrain what composes with what.

**Key insight**: Operations compose based on structural fit, not semantic coherence. An assemblage of mycorrhizal networks + ham radio + rare book collecting is domain-incoherent but can be structurally coherent for a given problem.

## What This Enables

**Stratified approach:**
- Problem: "I just moved to a new city and want to build a life here"
- Solution space: Networking advice, meetup apps, "put yourself out there"
- Limitation: Stays within conventional self-help territory

**Compositional approach:**
- Identify parallel concerns: shelter/territory, social/connection, work/sustenance, identity/becoming
- For each concern, identify structural constraints (not semantic categories)
- Query for operations addressing th
